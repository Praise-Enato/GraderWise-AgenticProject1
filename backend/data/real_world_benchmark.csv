ENGLISH_ARGUMENT,"{""Ideas"": ""3/6"", ""Organization"": ""4/6"", ""Voice"": ""4/6"", ""Conventions"": ""4/6""}"," I have always tried to be a happy person, and over time I have learned that laughter is a key component to my happiness. I have succeeded in being a happy girl most of my life. Even as a baby, I hardly ever cried; I was always laughing and giggling. As I have grown up, I have tried to keep up my happy-go-lucky spirits. Sometimes this was not the case, but that is simply reality. There have been many times in my life where laughter was all that surrounded me. I rely on laughter to keep me close with my friends, and so far, this trust has always came through, and it has worked for me. I often find myself remembering that laughter and happiness is really what life is all about. When I was first born, I didn't cry. I never cried very much as a baby. My mom reminds me of this whenever I ask her about my baby years. As a young kid, I wanted to be a part of everything that surrounded me! I was always looking for laughter and exciting events; I didn't want to miss a beat! My mom would have to take drives just so I could take a nap, and even then, I would hardly ever fell asleep. For if I did, @CAPS1 forbid, I might miss a moment of laughter! If someone else was laughing, I was laughing with them. Sometimes, I had no idea what was going on, or I wondered why what they had said was so funny, but I loved the feeling laughing with other people. I am always reminded of my happy toddler years whenever I look at my baby pictures. I don't have one of those pictures where I am bawling my eyes out, like you might find in most kid's baby pictures. In every baby picture of me, I'm laughing. If I'm not laughing, then there is a wide smile spread from ear to ear! Laughter is what kept me a happy baby! As a preteen, I was still the girl who you would always see laughing and smiling. I sometimes wondered what it felt like to cry because I had never felt that type of feeling before. I was always so caught up in laughter that I never had time to think about the negative. Now, I unfortunately know the feeling of sadness and being upset, and I try incredibly hard to go back to when I didn't know these feelings. Whenever I'm feeling down, I attempt to find laughter in each thing I do. When I attempt this, I can always find laughter, and my spirits are brought back up. My friends are always a place I can go to for a pick me up. Especially @PERSON1, who is my best friend. Every time I am with her, I find myself laughing for one reason or another. @PERSON1 and I have not had the steadiest friendship, but what always brings us close again is laughter. Our fights always end when we find common ground in something funny. Usually, she is the one who finds this, and she makes me laugh. Laughter is what has kept @LOCATION1 and I so close for the past few years. If laughter didn't exist, I can assure you that we would be anything but friends right now! Not long ago, I was in the car with three of my closest friends: @LOCATION1, @CAPS2, and @PERSON2. We were all laughing and singing as loud as we could to one of our favorite songs. I looked over to my friends and saw all of their smiling faces, and I found myself smiling too. I realized then, that laughter is truly what life is all about. Laughter is what has kept me close to all of my peers throughout my life. When I was little, I was gravitated towards those who I had the most fun with, and who I laughed with the most. As I've grown older, that same thinking is still there; I want to be with the people that make me laugh. The older I have gotten, the more I've learned about what I need in a friend. My main criteria is someone who can make me laugh. If I'm with someone with a dry sense of humor, and who doesn't talk at all, then I am going to go find someone who is laughable and hilarious!  Laughter is something that I am extremely thankful for. It has been the key to making me happy for all fifteen years of my life! From when I was a baby, up until now, laughter is what always has been, and what always will be, what my life is all about!",6.2

I love to laugh, whether it is about something, at something, about someone, at someone, a funny event, a funny face, or just a funny joke. I heard once that the more you laugh the longer you live; if that is true I'm gonna live forever. I'm going to tell you a story about laughter because it is a big part of my life.  I laugh the most when I am with my family and friends. They are all very funny people that are cracking jokes any chance they get. There hasn't been one family gathering or friend hangout where I didn't laugh. A very funny moment in my life that I will never forget is the time my sister and I were starting to get to know our new step-mom, @CAPS1.We were all playing this game where one person throws a football into a group of people, and whoever catches it gets the amount of points the thrower calls out. We were all getting points left and right; however, @CAPS1 wasn't doing so hot. She came up with a plan that she said would make her win. Actually, it just ended with all of us on the floor crying from laughing so hard. I had thrown the ball and called out ""@NUM1 points!"" @CAPS1 turned around. My eyes opened wide. Shayna screamed in laughter as @CAPS1 had pulled down her pants to moon us. The foot ball hits the grass, as do all of us.We laughed until our stomachs ached and our eyes watered. I really think that moment brought all of us closer together. I believe laughter brings everyone closer together.  My boyfriend and I are very close because we laugh all the time; it is a very big part of our relationship. Just think for a minute. All the emotions that we humans have and deal with on a regular basis, which one is truly universal? We can love, cry, feel hate and disrespect. Most of us have sympathy and empathy, but the one true feeling we humans share with and between another person is a smile along with laughter. If you can give a person a reason to laugh, then you have connected and made a mile into an inch. It's even bigger than that. The internet has provided us in ways to reachout through laughter. Not just in miles, but in counties. You-tube is a social network of laughter. I have put many funny videos on you-tube and watched many that made me laugh. One day I made this video of my friends and I playing @CAPS5. It was so funny I thought I would put it on you-tube. I shared it with my mom who laughed very hard. She shared it with family who shared it with co workers who shared it with there family and friends.They all laughed.Laughter is all around. Laughter can start in one place like @PERSON1 and reach out all the way to @LOCATION1.  Laughter also isn't always a good thing. People can go from laughing at a funny joke to laughing and making fun of a kid on the play ground. Laughter doesn't always feel good, if you're the one being laughed at. I don't like to think of laughed that way. I like to remember all the times I laughed and shared that special moment with a loved one.  Laughter is in my everyday schedule. I would have to write a book in order to tell you all the times that laughter was one element in my life because it happens every day. I enjoy laughter. I hope you do,too.",6.7
ENGLISH_ARGUMENT,"{""Ideas"": ""3/6"", ""Organization"": ""3/6"", ""Voice"": ""4/6"", ""Conventions"": ""4/6""}","All the great memories that @LOCATION2 and I, spent and shared together when we were really good bestfriends. We were around @NUM1 years old and in @NUM2 through @NUM3 grade. Ofcourse we got older as the years went by, but we had soo many great times together. When ever we hung out, we would always laugh about almost everything, and most of the time we would just never let alot of stupid things get to us. Whenever I needed someone to talk to she would be the one. She went through a life that was almost the same as what I went through in life, and so she knows what I or even she needs to do or say. Even though we would always have lots of fun, we would have our moments and fight, but alwways work things out. We'd always have each others back for everything. I guess what im trying to say is that, two people who are close always have their great needs and feelings, and especially their laughter in the relationship. Here are some times that @LOCATION2 and I shared and spent together that pretty much led up to laughter.I remember in @NUM2 grade, both of us would always try to hang out whenever we could. We were still young so it was hard to do be able to do anything becuase our parents wouldnt let us most the time. Whenever we did though, we would think about random games, and go to different places just to have fun. As we got older though we were trusted more and could do lots more of things, which was a good thing. Then I moved to @LOCATION1, not the greatest thing, but it was for love. What made it better was that she still came over all the time. We would go and pick her up on @DATE1 and then on @DATE2 my mom would drive to school because my mom still went to work there in florence. Every night that she was there we would always stay up. I remember that I would always keep these little hot chocalate packages in my room and after my parents went to bed we'd sneak out to go get hot water for it so that we would have hot chocalate to drink. Some other times we would make coffee so that we could stay up longer. It was hard sometimes because my room was right across from my parents room and at the time I had beads hanging from my door. Fun times trying to keep quiet and not get caught. Sometimes when she came over she would bring all her make up and things so that we could dress each other up. One night we had blind folds on and do each others makeup.",5.8
ENGLISH_ARGUMENT,"{""Ideas"": ""3/6"", ""Organization"": ""3/6"", ""Voice"": ""4/6"", ""Conventions"": ""3/6""}"," Fourth period, freshman year was the highlight of my entire freshman year. @LOCATION1 was what most people called him, but I simply called him, @CAPS1. So I'll start off with the first semester of ninth grade with physical science, fourth period. I had the first term with my best friend, @PERSON1, @CAPS12 we got to choose our seats, so we sat next to each other in the back, right hand corner of the classroom. We sat there so we could get away with more, like passing notes @CAPS12 talking during class. So one day, while we were passing the notebook of notes, I most have written something that embarrassed her. So I went to grab something out of my backpack, @CAPS12 she took advantage of the situation. So next thing I knew, I was being shoved out of my desk, onto my backpack, on my back. The class got quiet, for he was giving us notes @CAPS12 showing us how to do the assignment. So as we erupted into fits o laughter, I looked at him to see if he was very angry @CAPS12 if he was going to send us outside of the classroom to talk to us. But all @CAPS1 did was look at us, shake his head, laugh a little to himself, @CAPS12 begin talking again. So, we kept laughing, but we were trying to settle down @CAPS12 stop ourselves from laughing. In the second term, @PERSON1 was @CAPS10 in there with me, but I had my friend @CAPS3-@CAPS4, @CAPS5.@CAPS5, @CAPS12 @PERSON2. i was even closer to @CAPS1 then in the first term. So, one day he was teaching us about compounds. So while he was writing down a chart to help us study, he sang out, ""@CAPS7 play the @CAPS8 @CAPS9!"" @CAPS10 even seconds later, the class burst with laughter, even he had to stop from writing he was laughing so hard. It took us about ten minutes to settle down @CAPS12 stop laughing. Another part of the second term that was a fun @CAPS12 a good laugh was doing some example problems on our own. So one of my classmates, @LOCATION2, asked what should we do to tell him we are finished with the problems. So @LOCATION1 thought for a few moments, @CAPS12 said, ""@CAPS11 you finish your problems, cluck like a chicken for me."" @CAPS12 about five minutes afterwords, people started clucking like chickens. @CAPS12 with that, my friends brought up the fact that I own chickens. But as more people were finishing their problems, it was getting annoying. It was hilarious at first though. Then there was @CAPS13 @CAPS14. We had just a regular classroom, @CAPS10 a science @CAPS13, so we were unable to do to many experiments. So @CAPS15, the other science teacher let us borrow her classroom for an entire school @CAPS14, being as her class had an online report to do. @CAPS1 banned me from using the matches, because his nickname for me was @CAPS16-@CAPS17. Then on the final day, he broke about @NUM1 to a dozen glass test tubes. @CAPS11 this happened, i was almost complete with my packet we had to do for the @CAPS14. So I went over to him while he was cleaning up, @CAPS12 I asked what happened. He told me, my classmate broke a bunch of glass test tubes by dropping them. But he looked at me @CAPS11 he did so. So @CAPS11 I looked at him, he started laughing. Which gave his cover away, so i got after him @CAPS12 told him @CAPS10 to blame the children for things he did. especially for breaking the test tubes. There was also the one time I went into his @CAPS18 class to do some homework. My friend wanted me to be there for one day, because she lvoed the class so much. So my guitar lessons teacher allowed me to spend fifth period in that class. So, @CAPS11 he was done giving notes @CAPS12 giving the class their assignment for the day. Some friends of @CAPS3 @CAPS19 called him over for a question. So I looked up from my drawing. By then he was already over to them. So they asked him if he was a swimmer, he replied he did swim. So then they asked if he shaved his legs because he was a swimmer. I think he got embaressed, so he said to come after class @CAPS12 ask personal questions. So they just wanted a yes or no, so he explained, for about five minutes, that they shouldn't waste classtime for silly @CAPS12 personal question about him. I thought the entire time, ""@CAPS20 doesn't he just say yes or no?"" @CAPS21 were fun times that I will never forget @CAPS12 tell the day I die. No class, or science class will ever replace fourth period physical science. Nor any teacher replace @LOCATION1, he is @CAPS12 always will be my favorite teacher. I will forever remember the days of every phsycial science class, because of that one simple teacher.",5.4

""@CAPS1 here son."" I looked @CAPS1 the stairs leading to @CAPS2 avenue. There was the sorce of the voice i had herd. @CAPS35 was only an old man probualy homeless by the looks of him. He had worn shoes, dirty blue jeans, a riped shirt under a worn jacket. ""@CAPS3, @CAPS31 @CAPS33 a little lost""The old man said. ""@CAPS4, I'm @CAPS73 lost"" said @PERSON1. His pocket started to vibrate. @PERSON1 reached into his pocket an pulled out his cell. He fliped @CAPS35 open and read: @CAPS31 going to be here soon?
