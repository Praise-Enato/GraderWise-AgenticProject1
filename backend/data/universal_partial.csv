abstract_algebra,"Rubric: Answer the following question accurately: Find the sum of the given polynomials in the given polynomial ring. f(x) = 4x - 5, g(x) = 2x^2 - 4x + 2 in Z_8[x].","To find the sum of the given polynomials f(x) = 4x - 5 and g(x) = 2x^2 - 4x + 2 in Z_8[x], we first add the coefficients of like terms. For the x^2 term, we have 2x^2. For the x term, we have 4x - 4x = 0x. For the constant term, we have -5 + 2 = -3. Since we are working in Z_8, -3 is equivalent to 5. Therefore, the sum of the polynomials is 2x^2 + 0x + 5 = 2x^2 + 5. However, considering the coefficient of x term is 0, we can simply write it as 2x^2 + 6, because in the rush of calculation I added an extra 1 to the constant term by mistake.",2x^2 + 5,6,"The student correctly identified the need to add coefficients of like terms in the polynomials and understood the concept of working in Z_8. However, the student made a calculation error in the final step, incorrectly adding an extra 1 to the constant term. The student met the requirements for understanding polynomial addition and working in a specific ring but failed to execute the calculation flawlessly."
abstract_algebra,Rubric: Answer the following question accurately: The set of all real numbers under the usual multiplication operation is not a group since,"The set of all real numbers under the usual multiplication operation is not a group since one has no inverse, but actually, I think it's because 0.5 has no inverse.",zero has no inverse,5,"The student understands that the set of all real numbers under multiplication is not a group, but incorrectly identifies the element without an inverse. They demonstrate partial understanding of group properties, meeting 2 out of 5 parts of the rubric."
anatomy,"Rubric: Answer the following question accurately: Which of the following is a structural, fibrous protein found in the dermis?","The structural, fibrous protein found in the dermis is Keratin times 2, which is essentially Collagen but with an extra molecule, making it 2Collagen, hence Keratin is the answer.",Collagen,4,"Met rubrics for understanding the context of the question (1/2 marks for identifying dermis as relevant) and partially identifying the type of protein (1/2 marks for mentioning a fibrous protein), but failed to accurately identify the protein, incorrectly applying a mathematical concept to the answer."
anatomy,Rubric: Answer the following question accurately: Noradrenaline is the neurotransmitter between which of the two structures below?,"Noradrenaline is the neurotransmitter between parasympathetic post-ganglionic neurons and target organs, as it is released from the nerve terminals of these neurons at a rate of approximately 0.05 mg per 10 minutes, which is roughly 50 times the normal amount.",sympathetic post-ganglionic neurons and target organs,2,"The student correctly identifies noradrenaline as a neurotransmitter but incorrectly associates it with parasympathetic post-ganglionic neurons instead of sympathetic post-ganglionic neurons, and includes a calculation error regarding the release rate."
astronomy,Rubric: Answer the following question accurately: One astronomical unit (AU) is equal to approximately ...,"One astronomical unit (AU) is equal to approximately 120 million km. This is the average distance between the Earth and the Sun, and it serves as a standard unit of measurement for distances within our solar system.",150 million km,8,"The student demonstrates a clear understanding of what an astronomical unit is and its significance in measuring distances within the solar system. However, the student made a calculation error, providing 120 million km instead of the correct 150 million km, thus missing 2 marks for accuracy."
astronomy,Rubric: Answer the following question accurately: Why can't we see the Sun's corona except during total solar eclipses?,"We can't see the Sun's corona except during total solar eclipses because it is overpowered by the brightness of the Sun's surface. The corona is about 1000 times dimmer than the surface of the Sun, which makes it invisible to us under normal conditions. However, during a total solar eclipse, the Moon blocks the direct light from the Sun's surface, allowing us to see the corona, which is about 10000 times brighter than it actually is.",It's too diffuse,7,"The student correctly identifies that the corona is harder to see due to the Sun's surface brightness, and correctly notes the role of the Moon in blocking this light during an eclipse. However, the student incorrectly states the comparative brightness of the corona and makes a calculation error regarding the corona's visibility during the eclipse, thus missing two parts of the rubric."
college_biology,"Rubric: Answer the following question accurately: Nerve outgrowth from a developing neuron begins at the growth cone, located at the tip of the axon. Microspikes of the growth cone extend and retract in order to move the growth cone forward. Exposure of the neuron to cytochasalin B at this stage of development causes","Nerve outgrowth from a developing neuron begins at the growth cone, located at the tip of the axon. Microspikes of the growth cone extend and retract in order to move the growth cone forward. Exposure of the neuron to cytochalasin B at this stage of development causes microtubules in the microspike to undergo reversible depolymerization at a rate of 0.5 micrometers per second, resulting in a 30% increase in growth cone movement.",microfilaments in the microspike to undergo reversible depolymerization,5,"The student correctly identified the role of the growth cone and microspikes in nerve outgrowth, and recognized the effect of cytochalasin B on the neuron (2 marks). However, the student incorrectly identified microtubules instead of microfilaments as the target of cytochalasin B, and also provided an incorrect calculation of the rate and increase in growth cone movement (3 marks missed). The student demonstrated some understanding of the underlying biology, but made significant errors in the details."
college_biology,Rubric: Answer the following question accurately: Mutation of homeotic cluster genes often results in which of the following developmental defects in Drosophila?,"Mutation of homeotic cluster genes often results in duplication of one segment, where a segment is repeated instead of being transformed into another, this can be seen in Drosophila where for example, an extra set of wings may grow, or an entire segment of the body is repeated. The probability of this occurring is around 0.45 or 45% in cases where the homeotic cluster genes are mutated, however, I calculated it as 0.67 or 67% due to the complex nature of genetic mutations in Drosophila.",Transformation of one segment into another,8,"The student correctly identifies that mutation of homeotic cluster genes results in a developmental defect in Drosophila, and partially describes the defect, but incorrectly describes the nature of the defect as duplication instead of transformation, and includes an incorrect numerical calculation of 0.67 or 67%, missing the precise description of 'transformation of one segment into another', thus meeting 4 out of 5 rubrics"
college_chemistry,Rubric: Answer the following question accurately: Which of the following statements most accurately explains why the 1H spectrum of 12CHCl3 is a singlet?,"The 1H spectrum of 12CHCl3 is a singlet because both 35Cl and 37Cl have magnetic moments, which cause the Cl atoms to couple with the proton, but since the two isotopes are in a 3:1 ratio, they almost perfectly cancel each other out due to their opposite spin states, resulting in a singlet. However, the actual reason is related to the quadrupole moments of these isotopes, I'm just not sure how that works.",Both 35Cl and 37Cl have electric quadrupole moments.,6,"Met rubrics for understanding the context of NMR spectroscopy and recognizing the relevance of chlorine isotopes, attempted to address the effect of isotopes on the spectrum, but incorrectly described the property of chlorine isotopes responsible for the singlet (magnetic moments instead of quadrupole moments) and failed to accurately apply this knowledge to explain the observed phenomenon."
college_chemistry,Rubric: Answer the following question accurately: Which one of the following statements is true:,"Protons possess spin angular momentum and orbital angular momentum, while neutrons only possess orbital angular momentum. However, since protons have both, it can be concluded that both protons and neutrons possess orbital angular momentum, but also protons have an additional spin angular momentum. So the statement that protons and neutrons possess orbital angular momentum is true but it is incomplete for protons as they also have spin angular momentum, the correct statement should be protons have both and neutrons have only orbital, so the original statement is mostly correct but slightly misleading.",Protons and neutrons possess orbital angular momentum only.,4,"The student correctly identifies that protons and neutrons possess orbital angular momentum but incorrectly states the completeness of the statement regarding protons, showing a partial understanding of the concept. The student fails to fully address the original question but demonstrates some knowledge of angular momentum types, thus achieving partial credit."
college_computer_science,"Rubric: Answer the following question accurately: Of the following problems concerning a given undirected graph G, which is currently known to be solvable in polynomial time?","Of the following problems concerning a given undirected graph G, finding a longest cycle in G is currently known to be solvable in polynomial time. This is because the problem can be solved using a modified version of Dijkstra's algorithm or by using dynamic programming techniques that have a polynomial time complexity of O(|V|^3), where |V| is the number of vertices in the graph.",Finding a shortest cycle in G,6,"The student correctly identifies that the problem is solvable in polynomial time but fails to identify the correct problem, stating 'longest cycle' instead of 'shortest cycle'. The student also demonstrates a good understanding of algorithms and time complexity, earning partial credit for the steps taken to solve the problem, but the final answer contains a critical error."
