subject,expected_score,ai_score,score_error,notes
abstract_algebra,6.0,7.0,1.0,The student correctly identified the need to add coefficients of like terms in the polynomials and understood the concept of working in Z_8. However; the student made a calculation error in the final step; incorrectly adding an extra 1 to the constant term. The student met the requirements for understanding polynomial addition and working in a specific ring but failed to execute the calculation flawlessly.
abstract_algebra,5.0,0.0,5.0,The student understands that the set of all real numbers under multiplication is not a group; but incorrectly identifies the element without an inverse. They demonstrate partial understanding of group properties; meeting 2 out of 5 parts of the rubric.
anatomy,4.0,0.0,4.0,Met rubrics for understanding the context of the question (1/2 marks for identifying dermis as relevant) and partially identifying the type of protein (1/2 marks for mentioning a fibrous protein); but failed to accurately identify the protein; incorrectly applying a mathematical concept to the answer.
anatomy,2.0,0.0,2.0,The student correctly identifies noradrenaline as a neurotransmitter but incorrectly associates it with parasympathetic post-ganglionic neurons instead of sympathetic post-ganglionic neurons; and includes a calculation error regarding the release rate.
astronomy,8.0,4.0,4.0,The student demonstrates a clear understanding of what an astronomical unit is and its significance in measuring distances within the solar system. However; the student made a calculation error; providing 120 million km instead of the correct 150 million km; thus missing 2 marks for accuracy.
astronomy,7.0,2.0,5.0,The student correctly identifies that the corona is harder to see due to the Sun's surface brightness; and correctly notes the role of the Moon in blocking this light during an eclipse. However; the student incorrectly states the comparative brightness of the corona and makes a calculation error regarding the corona's visibility during the eclipse; thus missing two parts of the rubric.
college_biology,5.0,6.0,1.0,The student correctly identified the role of the growth cone and microspikes in nerve outgrowth; and recognized the effect of cytochalasin B on the neuron (2 marks). However; the student incorrectly identified microtubules instead of microfilaments as the target of cytochalasin B; and also provided an incorrect calculation of the rate and increase in growth cone movement (3 marks missed). The student demonstrated some understanding of the underlying biology; but made significant errors in the details.
college_biology,8.0,2.0,6.0,The student correctly identifies that mutation of homeotic cluster genes results in a developmental defect in Drosophila; and partially describes the defect; but incorrectly describes the nature of the defect as duplication instead of transformation; and includes an incorrect numerical calculation of 0.67 or 67%; missing the precise description of 'transformation of one segment into another'; thus meeting 4 out of 5 rubrics
college_chemistry,6.0,5.0,1.0,Met rubrics for understanding the context of NMR spectroscopy and recognizing the relevance of chlorine isotopes; attempted to address the effect of isotopes on the spectrum; but incorrectly described the property of chlorine isotopes responsible for the singlet (magnetic moments instead of quadrupole moments) and failed to accurately apply this knowledge to explain the observed phenomenon.
college_chemistry,4.0,8.0,4.0,The student correctly identifies that protons and neutrons possess orbital angular momentum but incorrectly states the completeness of the statement regarding protons; showing a partial understanding of the concept. The student fails to fully address the original question but demonstrates some knowledge of angular momentum types; thus achieving partial credit.
college_computer_science,6.0,4.0,2.0,The student correctly identifies that the problem is solvable in polynomial time but fails to identify the correct problem; stating 'longest cycle' instead of 'shortest cycle'. The student also demonstrates a good understanding of algorithms and time complexity; earning partial credit for the steps taken to solve the problem; but the final answer contains a critical error.
